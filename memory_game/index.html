	<h2>Instructions</h2>
	<p>
	Concentration, also known as Match Match, Memory, Pelmanism, Shinkei-suijaku, Pexeso or simply Pairs, is a card game in which all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards.

	<h3>Why should you play this game?</h3>
	<p>Because, who doesn't like games? This is also my first project for my class at General Assembly, so that's pretty neat. Let me know your thoughts on the game by sending me a message on LinkedIn. I have a link to my page below.</p>
